    "intro": "I'm 23 years old and a self-taught software engineer. I'm Brazilian but I live in Ireland. I work with Laravel, Vue.js, TailwindCss and I'm studying Testing. I created this website with the intention of posting blogs to give tips to those who have interest in studying web development. The term \"software engineering\" can often seem daunting, however, like everything in this life, you just need to study and be interested that you will surely will make it! The key to reaching your goal is to maintain your motivation. It may take weeks, months or most likely years, but anything is possible if you get out of your comfort zone."
